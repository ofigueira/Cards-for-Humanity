Some are even born without a hymen.  It is not indicative of whether one is a virgin or not. </p>

It typically takes about 12 to 16 days for the next period. However, some women have shorter cycles. Thus, you should not have sex without protection under the assumption you can’t get pregnant–you can. </p>

It maintains its pH by itself and these various washes and soaps can actually disrupt the natural acidity through the scents and chemicals that often come in these soaps. These chemicals can cause dryness, rashes, and/or irritation. Also, douches are also unnecessary and should never be used.</p>
